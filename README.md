Quake Enhanced Team Deathmatch multiplayer mod

## What is it?
This is a multiplayer deathmatch mod for Quake Enhanced that adds basic team-play support. This is a fork of QECTF that focuses soly on the teamplay improvements that make sense for deathmatch.

## How to install
1. Go to your 'Saved games' quake folder, NOT THE STEAM FOLDER. You can go to it by pressing Windows+R and typing: %userprofile%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\Id1
2. Create a folder called 'id1'
3. Create another folder and call it 'mpmod'. If you already have this folder, skip this step.
4. Extract zip into the 'id1' folder you created on step 2. If you already have an 'id1' folder, it's likely from another mod. Unfortunately, you'll have to replace it.

## How to run the mod
1. Open console and type 'game mpmod'
2. Start a multiplayer game
