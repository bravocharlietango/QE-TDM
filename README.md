Quake Enhanced - Team Deathmatch (Multiplayer Mod)

## What is it?
This is a multiplayer deathmatch mod focused primarily for Quake Enhanced that adds basic team-play support and some other fun additions. This started as a fork of QECTF that focused only on the teamplay improvements that make sense for deathmatch.

## How to download
1. Download a packaged release here or just the latest progs.dat file from the repository above.

## How to install
1. Go to your 'Saved games' quake folder, NOT THE STEAM FOLDER. You can go to it by pressing Windows+R and typing: %userprofile%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\
2. Create a folder called 'id1' if it does not already exist.
3. Create another folder and call it 'mpmod'. If you already have this folder, skip this step.
4. If you downloaded a release, unzip it. Move the progs.dat file into the 'id1' folder you created on step 2. 
   * If you already have an 'id1' folder, it's likely from another mod. Unfortunately, you'll have to replace it.

## How to run the mod
1. Open console and type 'game mpmod'
2. Start a multiplayer game
